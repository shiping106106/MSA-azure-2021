Problem 
During COVID the mandantory requirement of facemask have become hugely important as studies have shown that it leads to reducing virus transmisisons. Researchers predicted that if 80% of people wore mask it would reduce COVID-19 spread more than a strict lockdown.
Problem Statement
We don't have enough law officers that can see when people ain't wearing mask. Just how it's alot harder for police officers to catch people who are speeding, the use of speed cameras is very useful and can show the people not wearing mask very easily and people who are not social distancing.
AI can useful to solve this problem with use of face recognition technology and anyone not wearing masks can be readily seen. It could also be used before entering shops to scan face, similar to going through airport security. This would be an incentive to wear masks more and thus reduce COVID transmissions.
